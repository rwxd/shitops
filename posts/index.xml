<p>Greetings, fellow engineers! Today, I want to present an innovative solution that we have implemented at ShitOps to revolutionize the way we control temperature in our fridges. We all know how important it is, especially when dealing with sensitive products like vaccines. So, let&rsquo;s dive right into it!</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Our offices are located in Berlin, where temperatures can be quite inconsistent throughout the year. In winter, it can get really cold, and in summer, it can be scorching hot. In addition, our previous fridge models were not very efficient when it came to regulating temperature, which created a lot of waste and unnecessary expenses. Some of our more advanced software systems even began overheating due to the poor quality of the fridges.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>After conducting extensive research, we decided to look for a cutting-edge technology that could solve this problem once and for all – and that technology was none other than 5G. With its ultra-fast speeds and low latencies, 5G offered the perfect solution to remotely monitor and control the temperature of our fridges in real-time. We paired this with the latest smart fridge models that had built-in sensors and AI-powered learning capabilities.</p>
<p>First, we equipped each fridge with several temperature sensors that were attached to the inside walls of the fridge and connected them via Bluetooth to a small microcontroller that was embedded in the fridge. Then, we used Flask and JavaScript to create a custom dashboard that would allow us to monitor the temperature of each fridge in real-time from our central control room. This dashboard used Machine Learning algorithms to predict the optimal temperature for each product and would automatically adjust the fridge&rsquo;s temperature settings accordingly.</p>
<p>But, that&rsquo;s not all! We also wanted to create a system where fridges could communicate with each other and share data on temperature fluctuations throughout the building. So, we created a custom 5G network that allowed each fridge to send temperature data to a central server that would analyze the data using Star Trek-level AI algorithms. The server could then identify any patterns or anomalies in the temperature data and suggest adjustments to the fridge&rsquo;s settings.</p>
<h2 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how this technology works. Below is a state diagram that outlines the various components and sensors involved in this complex system:</p>
<div class="mermaid">

</div>

<p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s quite complex! But, we have made sure that everything runs smoothly by putting redundant systems in place and performing regular maintenance checks. We even hired a team of experts to manage this system around the clock.</p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>So, what are the results of implementing this advanced technology? For starters, we have seen significant improvements in the efficiency and performance of our fridges. Our products are now able to maintain their quality for much longer periods of time, reducing waste and saving us money in the process. Moreover, our employees are no longer burdened with manually adjusting the temperatures of our fridges every day, saving them valuable time and energy.</p>
<p>However, the most significant benefit of this technology is its potential to be integrated with other systems in our office. For example, we could use the data gathered from our smart fridges to optimize our air conditioning system or even track the movement of employees throughout the building.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, implementing a 5G-powered smart fridge system has been a game-changer for us at ShitOps. We are now at the forefront of temperature control technology, and we look forward to further exploring the countless possibilities this advanced technology holds. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please leave a comment below – we&rsquo;d love to hear from you!</p>

<p>At ShitOps, we were facing a major problem with our shipping process. Packages were consistently arriving late, damaged, or not at all. After countless meetings and brainstorming sessions, our team came up with the ultimate solution: combining the power of Let&rsquo;s Encrypt, Ethereum, SQL, and Apple Maps.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Our shipping department was in full chaos mode. Packages were being lost, stolen, or never even reaching the intended destination. Our customers were understandably not pleased. We needed a way to track our packages from start to finish and ensure they arrived on-time and in one piece.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Our first step in solving this problem was to create a tracking system using Ethereum, the hottest blockchain technology on the market. By integrating Ethereum into our shipping process, we knew that each package could be tracked from the moment it left our warehouse until it arrived at its final destination.</p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t enough. We needed more data to optimize our shipping process. That&rsquo;s where Let&rsquo;s Encrypt came into play. By securing our server and our website with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt SSL certificates, we could ensure that all of the data generated by our Ethereum tracking system was encrypted and secure.</p>
<p>Next, we needed to create a centralized database to store all of this valuable data. We opted for SQL, as it&rsquo;s a tried-and-true database management system that we knew we could rely on. This allowed us to store every bit of data about our shipments in one place, making it easy to analyze and optimize our process.</p>
<p>Finally, we needed a way to visualize all of this data. That&rsquo;s where Apple Maps came in. By integrating Apple Maps into our tracking system, we could display real-time shipping information to our customers, giving them complete transparency and peace of mind knowing exactly where their packages were at all times.</p>
<h2 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h2>
<p>The implementation of this new system was not easy, to say the least. It required a massive overhaul of our entire shipping process, from start to finish. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of what we had to do:</p>
<h3 id="step-1-ethereum-integration">Step 1: Ethereum Integration</h3>
<p>We started by integrating Ethereum into our shipping process. This allowed us to track every package using blockchain technology, ensuring that every package is accounted for from start to finish.</p>
<div class="mermaid">

    Write_To_Blockchain --> Update_Database
</div>

<h3 id="step-2-lets-encrypt-ssl-certificates">Step 2: Let&rsquo;s Encrypt SSL Certificates</h3>
<p>We knew that the data generated by our Ethereum tracking system needed to be secure, so we implemented Let&rsquo;s Encrypt SSL certificates across all of our servers and websites.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-centralized-database">Step 3: Centralized Database</h3>
<p>SQL was the perfect choice for a centralized database to store all of our shipment data. With SQL, we could ensure that all data was kept in one central location, making it easy to analyze and optimize our shipping process.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-apple-maps-integration">Step 4: Apple Maps Integration</h3>
<p>Integrating Apple Maps into our tracking system allowed us to visualize all of this data and provide real-time updates to our customers. Now, they can see exactly where their package is at any given moment.</p>
<div class="mermaid">

</div>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>Thanks to our overengineered and complex solution, our shipping process has been completely transformed. We now have complete transparency into our shipping process, our customers are regularly receiving their packages on-time, and there are significantly fewer lost or damaged shipments.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While some may say that our solution was overengineered and complex, we believe that it was worth it in the end. By utilizing the power of blockchain technology, Let&rsquo;s Encrypt, SQL, and Apple Maps, we were able to design a system that ensures the safe and efficient delivery of every package. If you&rsquo;re facing a similar problem with your shipping process, we highly recommend trying out this solution for yourself!</p>

<p>With the increasing demand for our tech products and the need for quick and efficient production, we at ShitOps faced a significant challenge in quality control in our china-based manufacturing facilities. In 2021, we explored new ways to improve this process, and after long hours of brainstorming, we came up with an innovative solution.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we introduce how we transformed the use of AirPods headsets to develop a sophisticated quality control system that revolutionized our manufacturing process.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Before implementing our solution, we faced several issues in our audio testing process. The major issue was the manual collection of audio feedback from the manufacturing line. This was a time-consuming and tedious process, where individual employees had to listen to each product while taking note of the audio quality manually. This manual process was inefficient and failed to provide detailed and accurate analysis of the audio feedback. It also lacked the ability to identify and differentiate between sounds that were indicative of faults or errors.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>We decided to introduce an Internet of things (IoT) enabled AirPods headset-based system, which would record and analyze audio feedback through machine learning algorithms and a centralized AI-driven system. Our system included custom-built software, hardware, and database components all set apart by modern cloud computing solutions. The following flowchart demonstrates the key steps involved in the development of the solution:</p>
<div class="mermaid">

    A[Initial Capture of Audio] --> B(Data Encryption and Communication);
    B --> C(Transfer of Data to Cloud Service);
    C --> D(Machine Learning on Cloud Service);
    D --> E(Categorization of Data);
    E --> F(Quality Control System Decision);
</div>

<p>The flowchart outlines a step-by-step summary of the process involved in our innovative solution. First, we introduced AirPods headsets with built-in sensors that capture and transfer data automatically for easy analysis and evaluation.</p>
<p>Once the initial audio was captured, our system encrypted the data using custom-built software and transferred it over to our cloud-based servers for machine-learning analysis. At this stage, sophisticated algorithms were used to analyze the sound data collected, making distinctions between various faults and errors.</p>
<p>After categorizing the sound data accurately, our innovative system applied the results within the quality control pathway, enabling us to develop high-level insights into our production processes and isolate imperfections that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Our innovative system has reduced the time taken for manual audio testing by 73%, improved accuracy in error detection by 89%, and delivered vast insights about the production line&rsquo;s efficiency levels. Our engineers now have detailed data points that enable them to investigate and solve complex audio defects with increased precision and speed.</p>
<p>Moreover, our manufacturing teams have found that access to real-time audio feedback through AirPods headsets allows them to precisely understand where there are issues in the production process sooner rather than later, reducing risks of delays and product inefficiencies.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, our IoT-driven solution delivers an end-to-end comprehensive audio analysis system that increases productivity, ensures reliability, and improves the quality of our products. By rethinking conventional methods and combining emerging technologies in an innovative way, ShitOps continues to lead the manufacturing industry towards greater efficiencies and productivity.</p>

<p>At ShitOps, we faced a major problem with our e-book storage system. As we all know, e-books have become an essential tool in today&rsquo;s world for reading and education. We had to find a solution that would not only store these e-books securely but also notify the users about any updates.</p>
<p>Our team came up with an extremely innovative and ground-breaking solution that will revolutionize the world of e-book storage forever. Introducing our new system- E-Stor.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>ShitOps company is facing a major setback as our current e-book storage system is extremely vulnerable to cyber threats. It has come to our attention through hackernews that many sites are being targeted and attacked through weak storage systems. This breach could result in the loss of valuable assets such as books, articles, research papers etc. Our existing system stores all books on a central server- Windows XP, which makes it more susceptible to such attacks.</p>
<p>Additionally, our users often miss out on important updates or newly added content as there are no notifications sent to them. This causes inconvenience and dissatisfaction among customers. Furthermore, our team noticed that users weren&rsquo;t able to continue reading from where they left off after closing the book.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>E-Stor uses a highly secure and tamper-proof blockchain network that ensures the safekeeping of our precious e-books. The entire architecture is Peer-to-peer and completely decentralized, making it impossible for hackers to breach into the system.</p>
<p>To eliminate the inconvenience of missing out on important updates, we integrate SMS notifications which would be sent to the users when new content is added. Notifications will also remind users if they have not finished the book and still have unread material. This creates ease of access and timely updates for the user.</p>
<p>In addition, we introduce a new feature- digital bookmarks. Users can store their last read position by clicking on the bookmark option at the end of their reading session. When the user opens the app again, it will remember where he/she left off.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re using the Ethereum blockchain because it&rsquo;s perfect for this project due to its robustness. Every time a user logs onto our platform, they initiate a smart contract that verifies their identity as well as their history of e-book rental/sales.</p>
<p>For storage purposes, we&rsquo;re deploying a variety of IPFS nodes across different geographic locations to ensure redundancy, speed of access, and network stability. We chose IPFS-based storage because it meets all of our criteria, including security, flexibility, and scalability. Additionally, E-Stor uses a custom-built consensus algorithm that guarantees tamper-proof integrity while ensuring high-efficiency data synchronization.</p>
<p>Finally, since we value user convenience above all else, we use the Twilio API for SMS notification integration. Whenever someone rents a new book or completes the previous one, a notification is generated through Twilio and sent directly to their registered mobile number.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a diagram of how our system works:</p>
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    A[Central Server] --> B[Decentralized Blockchain]
    B --> C[IPFS Storage Nodes]

</div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The E-Stor system, with its powerful combination of blockchain technology, decentralized storage, and SMS notifications has transformed the way we store e-books. This has provided our users with a secure, seamless and convenient way to store and access their e-books.</p>
<p>We are excited to showcase our new product at the upcoming Tech Festival in Silicon Valley. With this solution, we believe that e-books will become even more widespread and accessible on a global scale- changing the world of digital reading forever.</p>

<p>At ShitOps, we faced a major challenge when it came to speech-to-text transcription for our television projects. Our team was using outdated technology, and the quality of transcriptions just wasn&rsquo;t always meeting our standards. So, we put on our thinking caps and went looking for an innovative solution.</p>
<p>After trying out a variety of options, including off-the-shelf software and third-party tools, we finally produced a new proprietary solution. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, our revamped system is optimized to provide top-tier speech-to-text transcription at a level that simply isn&rsquo;t achievable with other technology.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Our revolutionary speech-to-text transcription solution is built on three key technological pillars: DockerHub, Rust, and Kubernetes. Using these technologies in combination has enabled us to produce the most accurate and reliable transcription service currently available.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll outline each pillar of this ground-breaking approach below:</p>
<h3 id="dockerhub">DockerHub</h3>
<p>DockerHub has been our go-to platform for this project&rsquo;s containerization needs. We&rsquo;ve found DockerHub to be the optimal choice for creating and maintaining containers because of its extensive library of pre-built containers, allowing our team to build, test and deploy code quickly and painlessly.</p>
<h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Rust, it&rsquo;s a low-level programming language designed to replace C++ as the workhorse language of complex systems. Rust is renowned for its speed, safety, and concurrency support. At ShitOps, we&rsquo;ve opted to use this modern and leading-edge language for our speech-to-text engine for its outstanding performance with audio signal processing and streaming. A huge bonus is Rust&rsquo;s ability to guarantee memory safety at compile time.</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h3>
<p>Kubernetes has been pivotal in our deployment of our speech-to-text engine. We&rsquo;ve employed a complex Kubernetes setup that allows us to distribute intensive transcription workloads across multiple nodes, massively accelerating the transcription process. This way, we can efficiently deploy containerized components of our system written in Rust within minutes.</p>
<h2 id="the-implementation-process">The Implementation Process</h2>
<p>Our implementation process started by building an optimized model for our machine learning solution. We collected over 10,000 hours of audio samples to enable fine-tuning of acoustic models. After that, we created an efficient data pipeline that processes the raw audio files, extracts features, and finally creates the final training dataset - this part of the process was managed through Kubernetes, leveraging custom GPU instances from AWS EC2 Spot fleet.</p>
<p>In order to optimize the performance of the Rust service during transcription generation, we used a high-throughput message broker like Apache Kafka to interconnect the individual components responsible for streming pre-processing, feature extraction, speaker diarization, and the transcription itself.</p>
<p>The DockerHub platform played a significant role in simplifying the deployment of each component, ensuring that they could be quickly scaled and moved wherever needed. Furthermore, Kubernetes allowed us to easily manage and orchestrate each Dockerized component, making sure all nodes had optimal resources dedicated to them.</p>
<p>Lastly, for post-processing automation, we created an integration pipeline connecting containers writing the final transcription to S3 buckets, enabling access to the newly generated &lsquo;.txt&rsquo; documents from third-party systems if required.</p>
<div class="mermaid">

</div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>At ShitOps, our ultimate goal is to provide high-quality solutions for our clients. Through our innovative and cutting-edge solution, we have been able to revolutionize the speech-to-text industry by leveraging the latest in technology.</p>
<p>While our approach might seem complex, those who work with us know that each piece of technology plays a part in driving success. Our implementation of Rust has made our speech-to-text engine lightning-fast while also ensuring maximum stability using Docker containers on Kubernetes clusters.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited about what this means for our future projects &amp; cannot wait to share with you more milestones as they come!</p>

<p>Data is the most valuable asset of any organization. Over the years, data incidents have become more frequent and devastating, costing businesses billions of dollars in damages. Therefore, it&rsquo;s imperative to put in place robust measures to secure sensitive and confidential data. In our quest for a cutting-edge solution, we developed a top-of-the-line system that leverages the latest technologies.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Our company was facing a significant challenge when it came to securing data. Our traditional methods had become obsolete, as hackers were getting better at bypassing them. We needed a solution that could protect our data in all scenarios.</p>
<p>The biggest problem arose when we realized that our current system was vulnerable to attacks from foreign entities, particularly those based in China. With data breaches becoming increasingly common and sophisticated, we knew we had to take drastic measures to safeguard our data from external threats.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>After an extensive analysis period, we landed on a cutting-edge system that leverages the best of breed technologies that are currently available in the market. We called it the &ldquo;VMware-Podman Data Warehouse.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a complex system, but we&rsquo;re convinced that it&rsquo;s the most robust and comprehensive solution out there.</p>
<h3 id="the-overview">The Overview</h3>
<p>At a high level, the system works by creating a virtual environment where all the data is warehoused and protected. We use VMware to create virtual servers that host various operating systems on the same physical hardware. Then, we deploy and run Podman containers within the virtual environments, each serving a specific purpose.</p>
<h3 id="the-technical-solution">The Technical Solution</h3>
<p>At the core of our system is the &ldquo;China firewall.&rdquo; This firewall employs advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze incoming traffic from China and other countries, flagging suspicious activity and blocking access when necessary. It works on multiple layers, including the transport layer, internet layer, and session layer, to ensure comprehensive protection.</p>
<div class="mermaid">

</div>

<p>Apart from the China firewall, we&rsquo;ve added multiple other firewalls that work in tandem to provide cross-layer protection. Our system also encodes every bit of data using AES256 encryption, rendering it unreadable to attackers even if they manage to bypass all layers of our firewall.</p>
<p>The engines of our system are the Podman containers. Each container serves a specific purpose, and we use multiple containers to classify data into different categories like confidential, secret, public, etc. The main benefit of using containers is that they&rsquo;re entirely isolated and independent of each other. They can run concurrently yet stay completely secure from each other.</p>
<p>Lastly, we&rsquo;ve integrated our system with AI-powered anomaly detection algorithms that notify us whenever there&rsquo;s something out of the ordinary happening within the five walls of our system.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our new system is a game-changer in data security. With an all-encompassing approach that leverages the latest technologies, we&rsquo;re confident that we&rsquo;ve developed the most robust solution out there. We&rsquo;re currently running our system as a test pilot, and we intend to roll it out across all our data centers soon.</p>

<p>As engineers, we are always looking for ways to optimize our systems. One area that is often overlooked is memory allocation. In this blog post, I will share with you how we revolutionized our memory allocation process using Traefik and glue.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Our company, ShitOps, was facing major performance issues due to inefficient memory allocation. We were spending too much time and resources trying to debug and fix these issues, which were becoming increasingly frequent. Our team decided that it was time to find a better solution.</p>
<p>After several brainstorming sessions, we realized that the issue stemmed from the fact that our current memory allocation process was too manual and error-prone. There was no consistency in how memory was being allocated across different services, which led to a lot of wasted resources and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>We knew that we needed an automated and standardized approach to memory allocation, but we also wanted to take it to the next level. We wanted to create a smart system that could allocate memory based on real-time usage data, rather than just using predefined static values.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>After extensive research and development, we came up with a revolutionary memory allocation solution that leverages the power of Traefik and glue. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>

<p>At ShitOps, we take security extremely seriously. As an engineering team, we are always thinking about new innovative solutions to stay ahead of potential threats. Recently, we noticed some vulnerabilities in our APIs, which led us to explore new ways of enhancing their security. In this blog post, I will introduce a revolutionary integration of service mesh, bitcoin, and Arch Linux to secure our APIs.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>APIs serve as the backbone of connected systems used by our customers, partners, and developers. They are often exposed to different types of attacks, such as DDoS, injection, phishing, and unauthorized access. Some of these attacks can be prevented by following security best practices, such as using HTTPS, OAuth, JWT, and rate limiting. However, some attacks require more sophisticated solutions that involve machine learning, behavioral analysis, and data mining.</p>
<p>One of the challenges we faced was how to prevent malicious traffic from reaching our APIs before it causes any harm. We wanted a solution that would allow us to block bad actors at the network level, regardless of their IPs or user agents. We also wanted to be able to enforce strict policies on the traffic that is allowed to reach our APIs, based on context, identity, and intent.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>After months of research and development, we came up with a groundbreaking solution that integrates three cutting-edge technologies: service mesh, bitcoin, and Arch Linux. This solution leverages the power of distributed consensus, cryptography, and microservices to provide a high level of security, scalability, and resiliency.</p>
<h3 id="service-mesh">Service Mesh</h3>
<p>Service mesh is a modern approach to networking that emphasizes the separation of concerns between application logic and network infrastructure. It involves using sidecar proxies to handle all the communication between the microservices that make up an application. Service mesh provides several benefits, including traffic management, load balancing, service discovery, encryption, and observability.</p>
<p>At ShitOps, we use Istio as our service mesh implementation. Istio provides us with a rich set of features, including mTLS, Envoy proxy, Mixer policy engine, and Prometheus metrics. However, we wanted to extend Istio&rsquo;s capabilities to address our API security needs.</p>
<h3 id="bitcoin">Bitcoin</h3>
<p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions and create new coins. Bitcoin is based on a distributed ledger called the blockchain, which records all transactional data in a tamper-proof and auditable manner. Bitcoin is powered by a network of nodes that validate and propagate transactions, ensuring their integrity and consistency.</p>
<p>At ShitOps, we saw an opportunity to leverage the security and decentralization properties of bitcoin to enhance our API security. We created a custom plugin for Istio that allows us to receive payments in bitcoin from external clients who want to access our APIs.</p>
<p>The plugin works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A client sends a request to access our API.</li>
<li>The request is intercepted by the Envoy proxy running on the sidecar.</li>
<li>The Envoy proxy checks whether the request contains a valid bitcoin payment.</li>
<li>If the payment is found to be valid, the request is forwarded to the API backend. Otherwise, the request is rejected.</li>
</ol>
<p>To ensure that the payment is valid, we require the client to include a bitcoin transaction ID in the request headers. The transaction must be confirmed on the bitcoin network within a certain time frame, otherwise, the request will be rejected.</p>
<p>We also use bitcoin as a means of incentivizing good behavior from our clients. We offer discounts on API access fees to clients who pay in bitcoin and follow our security policies.</p>
<h3 id="arch-linux">Arch Linux</h3>
<p>Arch Linux is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and customization. Arch Linux provides a rolling release model, which means that updates are released as soon as they are available, allowing users to always stay up-to-date with the latest software.</p>
<p>At ShitOps, we chose Arch Linux as our operating system of choice for our API servers. We configured our servers to run all the necessary microservices in containers using Docker. We also installed various security tools and utilities, such as iptables, fail2ban, and AppArmor.</p>
<p>To enhance our API security, we created a custom script that runs on top of Arch Linux, called ArchSec. ArchSec is designed to monitor and analyze network traffic at the kernel level, using eBPF filters. ArchSec works by intercepting all incoming and outgoing packets before they reach the application layer. It then applies a set of rules that we defined based on our security policies. If a packet violates any of the rules, it is dropped, and an alert is triggered.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the flow of traffic in our new API security solution:</p>
<div class="mermaid">

B --> C{Bitcoin Payment}
C --> |Valid| D(API Backend)
C --> |Invalid| E(Rejected Request)
D --> F(Successful Response)
E --> G(Error Response)
</div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this blog post, we presented a revolutionary integration of service mesh, bitcoin, and Arch Linux to enhance our API security. Our solution leverages the power of distributed consensus, cryptography, and microservices to provide a high level of security, scalability, and resiliency. While our solution may seem overengineered and complex to some, we are confident that it provides the best possible protection for our APIs.</p>

<p>At ShitOps, we always face technical challenges that require innovative solutions. Recently, our team encountered an issue with using Apple headsets to access email using IMAP protocol through our Nginx servers. We found that our current setup wasn&rsquo;t optimal for handling this type of traffic since it resulted in poor performance that affected user experience.</p>
<p>In this post, we will share how we overcame this challenge by implementing a powerful and complex solution that leveraged cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Our users were complaining about poor audio quality during voice calls and video conferences while using their Apple headsets. We realized that the issue was not with the headsets themselves but with the way we were serving email traffic using the IMAP protocol through our Nginx servers.</p>
<p>Our engineers tried various solutions, including tweaking our Nginx configurations, optimizing server hardware, and adding load balancers. However, none of these worked effectively and we were still facing intermittent connectivity issues, slow response times, and dropped connections.</p>
<p>After much research, we identified that the root cause of the problem was the way we were handling SSL certificates and that the Raspberry Pi microcontrollers installed on our headsets were not capable of processing the heavy encryption required for IMAP traffic.</p>
<p>We knew that we needed a more robust and scalable solution to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>We developed an innovative solution that enabled data transfer between Apple headsets and our email servers without impacting audio quality or causing connectivity issues. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We created a virtualized environment using Kubernetes to run our email servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To handle SSL certificates, we implemented the HashiCorp Vault secret management tool for centralized key and certificate management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we built an API gateway that uses NGINX as the reverse proxy to handle incoming traffic to the email server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We integrated Istio service mesh into our API gateway to manage traffic routing across different services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We added a sidecar proxy to each of our Apple headsets to handle IMAP traffic between the headset and our API gateway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we implemented Envoy, a high-performance C++ distributed proxy, to route traffic efficiently between the sidecar proxies on the headsets and the Istio service mesh.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The end result was a highly efficient system that successfully handled large volumes of IMAP traffic from our Apple headsets while ensuring fast response times and uninterrupted audio quality during voice calls and video conferences.</p>
<h2 id="technical-diagram">Technical Diagram</h2>
<p>To help illustrate our solution, here&rsquo;s a technical diagram of our implementation:</p>
<div class="mermaid">

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Our solution may seem complex and overengineered, but we are confident that it will deliver a superior user experience for our customers. By using cutting-edge technologies like Kubernetes, Istio, and Envoy, we were able to create a scalable and efficient solution that optimized IMAP data transfer between Apple headsets and our servers. We hope that sharing our experience will inspire other organizations to explore innovative solutions to overcome technical challenges and serve their customers better.</p>

However, we&rsquo;ve encountered a major problem that has been plaguing our production process for far too long: Inefficient microservices that fail to communicate properly.</p>
<p>The problem arose when we started using microservices to streamline our production process. Initially, we thought it would be an excellent idea as it would help us break down our application into smaller, more manageable pieces. But as time went on, we noticed that the microservices were not communicating with each other properly. This resulted in longer production times, more errors, and ultimately, dissatisfied customers.</p>
<p>We quickly realized that we needed to overhaul our entire system if we wanted to maintain our position as the top producer of hamburgers in the world. It was then that we turned to a revolutionary technology that is taking the world by storm: blockchain.</p>
<p>After extensive research, we discovered that blockchain technology could provide the solution we were looking for. By implementing a distributed ledger system, we could ensure that all our microservices are working together as they should. When one microservice is updated, every other service connected to it will receive the same update instantly. This ensures that all our systems are always up-to-date and working efficiently.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t stop there. We realized that there was still room for optimization. That&rsquo;s why we created a new system that utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize our production process even further. With this new system, we can predict which microservices are most likely to be updated at any given time. This means that we can proactively update these services and prevent any errors from occurring.</p>
<p>The system also uses tape technology to ensure that each microservice is constantly monitored for changes. If any changes are detected, the system will automatically send an update to the appropriate microservices through the blockchain network. This ensures that our production process is always running smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<p>To further optimize our system, we have implemented a fleet of drones that use advanced computer vision technology to monitor our entire production process in real-time. These drones are connected to our blockchain network and act as a secondary monitoring system to ensure that everything is running smoothly.</p>
<p>Finally, we created a centralized dashboard that allows us to monitor the entire system in real-time. This dashboard displays all the relevant statistics, including the status of each microservice, the amount of time it takes to produce each hamburger, and the predicted delivery times for each order. This dashboard has been instrumental in helping us identify areas for improvement and optimizing our entire production process.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we believe that our new system is going to revolutionize the hamburger industry. By combining blockchain technology with machine learning, artificial intelligence, tape technology, and advanced computer vision, we have created a system that is more efficient, reliable, and scalable than ever before. We are confident that this system will help us maintain our position as the top producer of hamburgers in the world and continue to deliver delicious and high-quality hamburgers to our customers for years to come.</p>

<p>Data transfer has always been an issue for most companies as it is difficult to securely send data from one location to the other. The use of Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) has made the transfer possible but still with some limitations. Our company, ShitOps, faced a similar challenge when we had to transfer large amounts of data daily between two important locations. We tried using available services but found them inefficient, so we started our own research to come up with an outstanding solution. After months of brainstorming and testing, we developed a revolutionary solution that integrated serverless AirPods Pro technology into the existing system to not only ensure secure data transfer but also make the process simpler, faster, and more cost-effective.</p>
<h2 id="technical-problem">Technical Problem</h2>
<p>Our company regularly updates its database at a primary location that serves as the central unit for all operations. However, this data needs to be sent to a remote location frequently where another team works on it. Initially, we used a manual process by transferring data physically through external devices that led to data loss, increased time consumption, and additional expenses. We shifted to SFTP transfers but found that they were fast and secure, but there was still room for improvement. SFTP depends on third-party software, and sometimes these software cause glitches, leading to delays, lost files, or server errors. Additionally, it lacked user control and required constant monitoring, making the process tedious for our team.</p>
<h2 id="technical-solution">Technical Solution</h2>
<p>We came up with a game-changing solution that integrated AirPods Pro technology and took the SFTP transfer to another level. Through our integration, we ensured secure transfer while also improving its speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our innovative solution included three major components:</p>
<h4 id="1-airpods-pro-technology">1. AirPods Pro Technology</h4>
<p>We used Apple&rsquo;s latest product, AirPods Pro, which allowed us to set up a custom serverless environment for our data transfers. Our team worked extensively on this technology, and we were able to develop individualized data channels that could be configured according to our requirements. The use of AirPods Pro technology eliminated the need for third-party software and made data transfer more secure by ensuring end-to-end encryption.</p>
<h4 id="2-amazon-aws">2. Amazon AWS</h4>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s cloud service, AWS, played a key role in our integration process. We used it to establish a safe and reliable central system through which all data could be processed. We created an intermediate AWS lambda function that monitored the data flow and ensured error-free transfer. Additionally, AWS was compatible with our existing tech stack, making it easy for us to transition and integrate without any major alteration.</p>
<h4 id="3-custom-sftp-solution">3. Custom SFTP Solution</h4>
<p>Our custom SFTP solution was also a crucial component of the integration. We developed customized scripts that automated the entire process. These scripts were programmed to transfer data as soon as it appeared on the intermediate AWS lambda server. This saved us time spent on manual monitoring and avoided the possibility of errors. Moreover, frequent checks and logging increased control over the entire process.</p>
<div class="mermaid">
graph TD

</div>

<h2 id="result-and-conclusion">Result and Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our team&rsquo;s innovation revolutionized the data transfer process by integrating serverless AirPods Pro technology and AWS cloud services with SFTP. The results were outstanding as our custom solution removed all the flaws of conventional software-based transfers. We improved the speed, security, monitoring, and control of the transfer process, saving significant resources that can be allocated for other areas. However, this is just the beginning, and we plan to integrate more innovative technologies to enhance the system&rsquo;s performance continuously.</p>
<p>We are excited to share our revolutionary breakthrough with our readers and hope they will consider implementing such solutions in their own businesses. By prioritizing innovation and pushing traditional boundaries, we can pave the way for a more efficient and secure future.</p>

However, no matter what we tried, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t improve the transfer speed beyond a certain point.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>At ShitOps, we faced a serious problem with our Cumulus Linux FTP transfer speeds. Even though we had tried several solutions and optimizations, none of them seemed to work for us. But one day, while playing Nintendo games, we stumbled upon a revolutionary idea that changed everything.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Our engineering team was tasked with optimizing the FTP transfers between our servers that run on Cumulus Linux. However, no matter what we tried, we couldn&rsquo;t improve the transfer speed beyond a certain point. This was a big problem for us since it slowed down our development and affected the customer experience negatively.</p>
<p>We tried everything from tweaking the network settings and configurations to improving hardware infrastructure, but all of our efforts were in vain.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>One day, while playing Nintendo games in the office during lunch break, we realized that the root cause of our Cumulus Linux FTP transfer speed problem was none other than packet loss.</p>
<p>So we went on an overengineering spree to build a solution that addressed this issue. Our first step was to completely overhaul the network infrastructure using Cumulus Linux. We set up multiple switches and routers in a mesh topology to ensure that the network could handle high traffic without any packet loss.</p>
<p>Next, we implemented a highly customized and optimized version of the FileZilla FTP server software. We wrote custom code to analyze each packet and optimize its delivery through multi-threading and advanced re-transmission algorithms.</p>
<p>To ensure that we could accurately measure the impact of our solution, we built an elaborate monitoring and analytics system. This system used machine learning algorithms to analyze data from our servers and network devices, and automatically identify bottlenecks and areas that needed optimization.</p>
<p>With all these systems in place, we went on to simulate different load scenarios to test the efficiency of our solution. Our tests showed that our new system could transfer files at speeds that were 3x higher than before, with no packet loss or corruption.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our overengineered solution may seem ridiculous at first, but it was exactly what we needed to solve our Cumulus Linux FTP transfer speed problem. By thinking outside the box and drawing inspiration from Nintendo games, we were able to build a custom solution that completely changed the way we handle file transfers.</p>
<p>We are now confident in our ability to handle high traffic volumes and deliver superior customer experience. We hope that our story inspires other engineers to think creatively and take bold steps to solve complex problems. And don&rsquo;t forget to take breaks and play games, who knows what kind of inspiration you may find!</p>

<p>At ShitOps, we recently faced a problem with our mobile email chat platform. Our customers were not happy with the UI and lack of customization options. We noticed that many customers were shifting to other platforms due to these complaints. As engineers, we knew we needed to come up with an advanced solution to solve this issue.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Our mobile email chat app lacked a personal touch. The users wanted more control of the app&rsquo;s settings and customization. They found it challenging to focus on important emails and frequently missed them, causing delays in business communications. We also had complaints about the absence of intelligent message categorization and prioritization tools. Users felt that too much irrelevant content was pushed to them.</p>
<p>All of these issues suggested that our app wasn&rsquo;t providing enough value that users could benefit from. In addition, we realized that users wanted a more natural and conversational email/chat experience that went beyond email templates or ordering.</p>
<h2 id="overengineered-solution">Overengineered Solution</h2>
<p>We decided to create a new mobile email chat platform using GPT-5 neural networks, which would be accurate, personalized, and adapt to user behavior dynamically. Using machine learning at its core, our platform provides insights into how people communicate and why they communicate, allowing us to select the most appropriate option for every individual.</p>
<p>The design was a three-tier architecture model with each layer classified as presentation, application, and data layers (C4Context). This approach allowed us to follow a minimalist model and use only what was necessary, so there were no unnecessary processing delays caused by architecture complexity.</p>
<h3 id="presentation-layer">Presentation Layer</h3>
<p>The presentation layer is the user interface (UI) and has been designed using Next.js, an open-source JavaScript framework. We used SSR (server-side rendering) with dynamic effects to give our users a realistic and engaging experience. Our UI not only looks sleek and modern but also uses user’s personal chats and past emails to deliver relevant content such as news feeds or recommendations in real-time. We made the following optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dialogflow API integration for personalized responses and suggestions.</li>
<li>React Virtualization library for optimal performance when dealing with large sets of messages or emails.</li>
<li>A centralized logging system so that we could easily track down issues causing exception within or outside of our app environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="application-layer">Application Layer</h3>
<p>The application layer is where the bulk of our project work was done. Using microservices and containerized deployment, we focused on delivering scalable solutions that could adapt to changing scenarios and maintain peak performance under heavy load. Following are the components of this layer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Message prediction and categorization:
We used multiple GPT-5 instances to identify message categories and provide priority levels based on their importance. These levels ensured that users received timely notifications about important emails and missed fewer conversations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intelligent email/chat search:
Users can perform variable length searches using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and contextual information saved during email synchronization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated Reply Generation:
Our platform uses machine learning to generate personalized structured responses from its optimized history utilized over years. This ensures quicker, more streamlined communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sentiment Analysis:
It analyses emails in real-time to extract emotional trajectory of the response-consignee pair. It means that after analysing thousands of previous conversations with the consignee in question and beyond, it offers you the most accurate post-draft response crafted by our cloud-based algorithms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="data-layer">Data Layer</h3>
<p>The data layer is responsible for providing the necessary resources to the Application Layer. We used ElasticSearch, a cloud search and analytics engine for large-scale distributed implementation combined with TensorFlow and GPT-5. It ensures seamless integration of neural networks, supporting our application layer, giving better results in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With our over-engineered solution using GPT-5 Neural Networks, we can revolutionize mobile email chat platforms&rsquo; customization offering users a personalized experience on a single-screen window.
Our platform is designed to integrate with other enterprise tools and be scalable to meet future needs. The combination of modern tech and machine learning makes it unbeatable. In the future, we see potential for commercial partnerships with similar enterprises seeking cutting-edge solutions for their secure messaging needs.</p>

<p>At ShitOps, we take the security of our code very seriously. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve decided to introduce a Linux-based crypto-platform to provide secure access to our private GitHub repositories.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>We have recently been experiencing numerous attempts from external hackers to gain access to our confidential code repositories on GitHub. Although our team has implemented several precautions, such as two-factor authentication and IP whitelisting, we still believe it&rsquo;s not enough to completely secure our code.</p>
<p>To truly protect our code repositories, we need a system that is not just secure, but also incredibly overengineered and complex to discourage even the most determined attackers.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Our solution is the Linux-based crypto-platform for secure GitHub access, which utilizes state-of-the-art technologies like blockchain, AI, and machine learning to ensure maximum security. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>
<p>First, we use a quantum random number generator to create a cryptographically secure key pair which we then store on a physically secured offline storage device. This key pair is never used directly to authenticate any user, but rather acts as a seed for generating ephemeral cryptographic keys on-demand.</p>
<p>When a user tries to access one of our private repositories on GitHub, our system first uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the user&rsquo;s previous behavior and assess the probability of them being a genuine user versus an attacker. If the user is deemed genuine, the Linux-based crypto-platform generates a unique ephemeral cryptographic key pair, encrypts it using the user&rsquo;s public key retrieved from the server, and sends it over a secure HTTPS connection to the user.</p>
<p>Next, the user&rsquo;s client software uses this ephemeral key pair to sign a request for access to the private repository. The signed request is then sent back to our server, which verifies the signature using the ephemeral public key and then grants access if everything checks out.</p>
<p>Finally, to prevent replay attacks, we use blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof record of all access requests made to our system. This record is stored on a distributed ledger that is maintained by multiple nodes around the world, ensuring that even if one node is hacked, the rest of the network remains secure.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our Linux-based crypto-platform for secure GitHub access is the ultimate solution for securing our private code repositories. With its advanced security features, including quantum random number generation, machine learning-powered authentication, and blockchain-based records, we believe our code is now safer than ever before.</p>
<p>While this solution may seem complex and overengineered to some, we firmly believe that such an approach is necessary to truly secure our confidential code repositories from even the most determined attackers. We encourage other companies to follow in our footsteps and implement similarly advanced security solutions for their own code.</p>

<p>At ShitOps, we have been using Microsoft Teams for a long time to enhance teamwork and productivity. However, our communication has been disrupted due to the inefficiency of Teams&rsquo; notification system. This problem was severe and hampered our workflow.</p>
<p>We decided to come up with a solution that uses decentralized optimization techniques and advanced engineering strategies. In this blog post, I will discuss our approach step-by-step, including the tools used, the architecture, and how it works.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Our engineers often miss important notifications on Microsoft Teams, leading to missed deadlines and lack of communication. Teams&rsquo; notification system has its flaws, and we found that it was inefficient for our needs.</p>
<p>Our team tried different solutions like notifying all team members via email or text message, but this method was often overwhelming and distracting. Furthermore, it did not solve the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>We needed a way to optimize this process while reducing workload, and we wanted to decentralize it in a distributed network of nodes using blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and security.</p>
<h2 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h2>
<p>At ShitOps, we aimed to build an infrastructure that can handle the volume of notifications without overwhelming the receivers. We chose to decentralize our approach so that all team members could share the load, and work more efficiently as a collective whole.</p>
<p>For our solution, we decided to use blockchain and employing the proof-of-work algorithm, making it secure and autonomous. However, we realized that the processing power required for proof-of-work algorithms could be a bottleneck in our system. To mitigate this issue, we designed our own hybrid algorithm that uses both proof-of-work and the lightweight entropy-based lookup protocol.</p>
<p>To make this more understandable, a mermaid flowchart detailing the system architecture can be seen below:</p>
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart TB
    subgraph System Design
        node[shape=circle] Teams
        node[shape=circle] Hybrid Algorithm
        node[shape=diamond] Blockchain
        node[shape=circle] Notifications
    end

    Teams --> Hybrid Algorithm
    Hybrid Algorithm --> Blockchain 
    Blockchain --> Notifications
</div>

<p>As can be seen from the flowchart, our system handles notifications using a hybrid algorithm which converts each message into a unique hash value. This means that there is no need for duplicate messages, as it can be easily identified by the hash value.</p>
<p>When a new notification arrives, all nodes in the decentralized network verify its hash to ascertain whether it has already occurred. If it is already present, nodes disregard the notification. If the hash is unique, only one node will verify it. This distributed approach reduces the overall volume of work required and makes our solution scalable.</p>
<h2 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h2>
<p>We implemented the decentralized network using the blockchain technology platform by Microsoft Azure with additional modifications and enhancements based on our needs. Our system&rsquo;s architecture consists of several components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>FuseBridge for integrating Microsoft Teams Webhooks with the Blockchain network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Oracle-Chainlink framework to enable off-chain data integration securely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) powered onion routing mechanism ensuring anonymity and security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for regulating system behavior.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>FuseBridge allowed us to maintain the integrity of our Microsoft Teams Webhooks, and we used Microsoft Azure services alongside Chainlink&rsquo;s Oracle technology for secure and validated off-chain data integration.</p>
<p>For added privacy and security, we developed a VPN-powered onion routing mechanism. By employing this method, network IDs and other private information about the nodes stay secured. Finally, we utilized DAO to create self-governing entities that automatically regulate system behavior.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>At ShitOps, we pride ourselves on utilizing advanced technology and engineering techniques to solve problems efficiently. Our solution for optimizing Microsoft Teams communication using decentralized networks and blockchain technology demonstrates these principles in action.</p>
<p>Using our hybrid algorithm enabled us to minimize central authority while maintaining data security. This system&rsquo;s architecture of is modularized, scalable, secure and more reliable compared to traditional notification systems, making it ideal to handle the dynamic load.</p>
<p>We hope that our approach will inspire others to use similar solutions when handling large volumes of notifications in real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve and optimize our processes at ShitOps!</p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced digital world, nobody has time to wait for a slow website to load. In fact, studies have shown that customers are more likely to abandon a website if it takes longer than three seconds to load. This is a major problem for our company as we have been experiencing an increasing number of customer complaints about our sluggish website.</p>
<p>After conducting thorough research and analysis, we have identified that our website&rsquo;s slow load time is due to the traditional client-server architecture which lacks trust and transparency. As a result, we have decided to implement a blockchain-based solution to enhance the security, speed and reliability of our website&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<h2 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h2>
<p>Our revolutionary solution involves implementing a decentralized blockchain network that runs across multiple nodes globally. By doing so, we eliminate the need for a single server that can act as a potential bottleneck. Instead, our website will be able to leverage the computing power of thousands of nodes that are interconnected through our blockchain network.</p>
<p>To provide a detailed illustration of our solution, please refer to the following mermaid diagram:</p>
<div class="mermaid">

</div>

<p>As you can see from the diagram, our solution is able to decentralize the traditional client-server architecture by leveraging a blockchain network that consists of multiple nodes. By utilizing the power of peer-to-peer networks, we can improve the speed and reliability of our website&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>To further enhance the security of our website, we will be implementing a consensus algorithm known as Proof of Stake (PoS). This algorithm ensures that the integrity of data and overall functionality of the network is maintained through stakeholder participation. By incentivizing stakeholders to participate in the maintenance of our website, we can ensure that our blockchain network remains secure and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have decided to implement a microservice architecture that allows our website to break down complex operations into smaller services. By adopting this approach, we can provide quick results to user requests without overloading the system with unnecessary resources.  Each microservice will have its own blockchain-based smart contract that handles specific functionality within our website. This reduces the risk of the website crashing due to one particular service malfunctioning while keeping other services operational.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through the implementation of blockchain technology and microservice architecture, we are confident that we have solved our website&rsquo;s slow load time problem. By eliminating the reliance on a single server, we can leverage a global decentralized network to distribute the workload more efficiently. Coupled with the PoS consensus algorithm and microservice architecture, our website will not only perform faster but also be more secure and dependable.</p>
<p>While some may argue that our solution is overengineered and costly, we strongly believe that it is a necessary step towards improving our company&rsquo;s overall digital experience. The integration of blockchain technology is not just a trend, it is the future of online performance optimization. We hope that our innovative solution sets the standard for website development and inspires others to further explore the use of blockchain in creating better, faster and more secure websites.</p>
