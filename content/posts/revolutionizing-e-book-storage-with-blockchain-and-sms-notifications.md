## Introduction

At ShitOps, we faced a major problem with our e-book storage system. As we all know, e-books have become an essential tool in today's world for reading and education. We had to find a solution that would not only store these e-books securely but also notify the users about any updates.

Our team came up with an extremely innovative and ground-breaking solution that will revolutionize the world of e-book storage forever. Introducing our new system- E-Stor.


## Problem Statement

ShitOps company is facing a major setback as our current e-book storage system is extremely vulnerable to cyber threats. It has come to our attention through hackernews that many sites are being targeted and attacked through weak storage systems. This breach could result in the loss of valuable assets such as books, articles, research papers etc. Our existing system stores all books on a central server- Windows XP, which makes it more susceptible to such attacks.

Additionally, our users often miss out on important updates or newly added content as there are no notifications sent to them. This causes inconvenience and dissatisfaction among customers. Furthermore, our team noticed that users weren't able to continue reading from where they left off after closing the book. 

## Solution

E-Stor uses a highly secure and tamper-proof blockchain network that ensures the safekeeping of our precious e-books. The entire architecture is Peer-to-peer and completely decentralized, making it impossible for hackers to breach into the system.

To eliminate the inconvenience of missing out on important updates, we integrate SMS notifications which would be sent to the users when new content is added. Notifications will also remind users if they have not finished the book and still have unread material. This creates ease of access and timely updates for the user.

In addition, we introduce a new feature- digital bookmarks. Users can store their last read position by clicking on the bookmark option at the end of their reading session. When the user opens the app again, it will remember where he/she left off.


## Technical Details

We're using the Ethereum blockchain because it's perfect for this project due to its robustness. Every time a user logs onto our platform, they initiate a smart contract that verifies their identity as well as their history of e-book rental/sales. 

For storage purposes, we're deploying a variety of IPFS nodes across different geographic locations to ensure redundancy, speed of access, and network stability. We chose IPFS-based storage because it meets all of our criteria, including security, flexibility, and scalability. Additionally, E-Stor uses a custom-built consensus algorithm that guarantees tamper-proof integrity while ensuring high-efficiency data synchronization.

Finally, since we value user convenience above all else, we use the Twilio API for SMS notification integration. Whenever someone rents a new book or completes the previous one, a notification is generated through Twilio and sent directly to their registered mobile number.

Here's a diagram of how our system works:

## Conclusion

The E-Stor system, with its powerful combination of blockchain technology, decentralized storage, and SMS notifications has transformed the way we store e-books. This has provided our users with a secure, seamless and convenient way to store and access their e-books. 

We are excited to showcase our new product at the upcoming Tech Festival in Silicon Valley. With this solution, we believe that e-books will become even more widespread and accessible on a global scale- changing the world of digital reading forever.
