# Introduction

Welcome, fellow engineers, to another exciting blog post on the ShitOps engineering blog. Today, I want to share with you our groundbreaking solution to a long-standing problem that has plagued our company – hybrid site-to-site communication. Our team of brilliant minds has put together an overengineered and complex solution that will revolutionize the way we communicate between multiple sites. Get ready to immerse yourself in the world of homomorphic encryption, Golang, the Rocket web framework, and endless possibilities!

## The Problem

In 2021, as our company expanded its operations to space, we faced a significant challenge in establishing seamless communication between our Earth-based data center and our satellite cluster orbiting the planet. Traditional methods were simply not sufficient to handle the immense scale and complexity of this interplanetary communication.

The existing solution involved using a VPN tunnel to establish a secure connection between the two sites. However, due to the limited bandwidth and high latency inherent in space communication, this approach resulted in frequent timeouts and packet loss. It became clear that a new, more robust and efficient method was desperately needed.

## The Solution

After months of brainstorming, scrum meetings, and late-night coding sessions, we are proud to present our overengineered solution – Homomorphic Encryption-powered Hybrid Site-2-Site Communication Using Golang and the Rocket Web Framework! Brace yourselves, because this is going to blow your mind.

### Step 1: Establishing the Communication Channel

To overcome the challenges of interplanetary communication, we decided to leverage Homomorphic Encryption, a cutting-edge technique that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. This approach ensures end-to-end security while maintaining a high level of privacy and integrity.

We started by designing a custom protocol based on encrypted hybrid site-to-site communication using Golang. We then implemented this protocol using the Rocket web framework, known for its lightning-fast performance and scalability. By combining the power of Golang and Rocket, we created an ultra-efficient communication channel that can handle massive amounts of data with minimal latency.

### Step 2: Data Transformation

Once the communication channel was established, we faced the challenge of transforming the data between the Earth-based data center and the satellite cluster. The stark differences in computing architectures and protocols posed a significant hurdle.

Undeterred by the complexity, we developed a sophisticated data transformation layer that seamlessly converts data from one format to another using advanced machine learning algorithms. Our system intelligently adapts to the target environment, optimizing the data for transmission across the vastness of space.

### Step 3: Intelligent Routing

Routing data across different sites is no simple task, especially when dealing with interplanetary distances. To tackle this challenge, we employed a state-of-the-art intelligent routing algorithm that dynamically selects the most efficient path for each packet, taking into account factors such as network congestion, latency, and available bandwidth.

The routing algorithm considers real-time telemetry data from our satellites to make informed decisions about routing paths. A complex decision-making process is used to determine the optimal route, ensuring minimal latency and efficient resource utilization.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have presented an overengineered and complex solution to address the problem of hybrid site-to-site communication. By harnessing the power of Homomorphic Encryption, Golang, and the Rocket Web Framework, we have taken a giant leap forward in revolutionizing how our company communicates between multiple sites, including those residing in space.

While some may argue that our solution is unnecessary and overly complex, we firmly believe in pushing the boundaries of technology and exploring uncharted territories. Our engineering team has put countless hours into this endeavor, and their dedication will undoubtedly pay off as we witness the seamless communication between Earth and space, powered by our groundbreaking solution.

Stay tuned for more exciting blog posts where we continue to challenge conventional wisdom and push the limits of what's possible in engineering!
