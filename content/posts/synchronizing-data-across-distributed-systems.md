## Introduction

Have you ever faced the challenge of keeping data synchronized across multiple distributed systems? If so, you know it can be a real headache. Especially when dealing with a high load of transactions. That's why our team has come up with a cutting-edge solution that revolutionizes how data is synchronized across multiple distributed systems. 

In this blog post, I'll walk you through our solution step by step, showing you how it works and how it eradicates the issues that commonly plague distributed data synchronization. 

## The Problem

Our company, ABC Inc., operates a large-scale distributed system that spans multiple data centers globally. Our system has millions of users, each generating hundreds of transactions per second. In order to ensure that all relevant data is available across all nodes, we need to keep all transactional data synchronized. The current data synchronization process is problematic for two main reasons:

1. High Latency: When a transaction is processed, the data propagation across all nodes takes too long to complete. This means other transactions related to the data cannot be processed until the synchronization is complete.

2. Data Consistency: Data inconsistencies are common when dealing with a large number of nodes. Some nodes may not receive an update on time, leading to data inconsistencies which can be difficult to resolve.

## The Solution

We proposed a new approach that splits the data payload into multiple, smaller messages that are propagated across the network. Our solution is a complex, multi-layered system utilizing latest cutting-edge technologies and frameworks. 

To demonstrate our solution, let's look at the transactional flow of a single transaction:

1. When a transaction is initiated, the ABC system captures the transactional data payload and encrypts it using a hybrid encryption algorithm - using a combination of asymmetric cryptography for the public key and symmetric cryptography for the private key. 

2. The encrypted data payload is broken down into multiple, smaller messages. Each message is then assigned a unique message identifier (UUID).

3. The message identifier and encrypted message payload are sent to the message broker, Apache Kafka, for distribution and processing. 

4. Kafka distributes the message among the nodes specified in the destination field as per the customer's architecture. Once a node receives a message, it processes the encrypted payload. 

5. The data is synchronized across all nodes by passing the processed data through the process of Distributed Consensus Protocol as per the customer requirement. Once reached to consensus the final result is updated in the data store of each node achieving consistency guarantees.

6. Nodes can request additional data from other nodes if required. This is done using a custom-built node request proxy that retrieves data on behalf of the requesting node.

7. Once the data is completely synchronized across all nodes, the transaction is marked as complete, and any additional related transactions can be processed.

## In-Depth Overview

Let's take a deeper look at each step of our solution. 

### Message Segmentation

When a transaction is initiated, the ABC system captures the transactional data payload and encrypts it using a hybrid encryption algorithm as described earlier. The encrypted data payload is then broken down into multiple, smaller messages. Each message is then assigned a unique message identifier (UUID). This is done to avoid atomicity and durability-related issues that arise during the propagation of messages. 

### Message Distribution

The message identifier and encrypted data payload are sent to Kafka for distribution and processing. Kafka distributes the message among the nodes specified in the destination field as per the customer's architecture. 

### Data Processing

Once a node receives a message, it processes the message's encrypted payload. The node then passes the processed data through a Distributed Consensus Protocol as per customer requirement. Once reached to consensus the final result is updated in the data store of each node.

### Node Request Proxy

Nodes can request additional data from other nodes if required. This is done using a custom-built node request proxy that retrieves data on behalf of the requesting node. The proxy ensures that only nodes with the correct read permissions can retrieve the requested data.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our new approach to data synchronization is a game-changer for distributed systems. By breaking down messages into smaller payloads, we are able to reduce latency and increase data consistency, thereby improving our system's efficiency. 

Our solution may be complex and overengineered, but we're passionate about ensuring our customers receive the best possible service. We believe that our solution is cost-effective and sustainable in the long term, and we look forward to implementing it in our own systems and those of our clients.
