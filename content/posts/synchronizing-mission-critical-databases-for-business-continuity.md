## Introduction

Welcome back to the ShitOps Engineering Blog! In today's post, we will be discussing a critical issue that many companies face when it comes to ensuring business continuity: database synchronization. Effectively managing and synchronizing databases is crucial for maintaining the availability and integrity of data, especially in mission-critical systems. In this post, we will delve into our innovative solution for synchronizing MariaDB databases across geographical locations, ensuring seamless data replication for uninterrupted operations.

## The Problem

At ShitOps, we have teams working in both San Francisco and Europe, each managing their own set of databases. Our engineers often face challenges when it comes to keeping database replicas in sync between these two locations. This becomes even more critical in the event of a disaster, where we need to ensure smooth failover and minimal data loss. Our existing synchronization process involves manually copying databases using SSHFS, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and not suitable for an enterprise-grade solution. We needed a robust and automated approach that would simplify the process while guaranteeing consistent and secure synchronization.

## The Proposed Solution

After extensive research and exploration of various technologies, we are excited to introduce our cutting-edge solution for database synchronization: **Checkpoint CloudGuard Sync**. Leveraging the power of cloud-based synchronization coupled with advanced automation techniques, CloudGuard Sync offers unparalleled performance and reliability for syncing MariaDB databases across multiple locations.

### High-Level Overview

To give you a better understanding of how our solution works, let's walk through a high-level workflow diagram:

  participant ClientApp as "Client Application"
  participant DBServerSF as "Database Server (San Francisco)"
  participant DBServerEU as "Database Server (Europe)"

  ClientApp ->> DBServerSF: Send write query
  DBServerSF -->> ClientApp: Respond with success

  Note right of DBServerSF: Data updated locally

  ClientApp ->> DBServerEU: Send log record
  DBServerEU -->> ClientApp: Respond with acknowledgement

  Note right of DBServerEU: Log record received

  ClientApp ->> DBServerSF: Request sync
  DBServerSF ->> DBServerEU: Sync request

  DBServerEU ->> DBServerSF: Send missing data
  DBServerSF ->> DBServerEU: Apply data changes

  Note left of DBServerSF,DBServerEU: Databases synchronized

### Detailed Explanation

Let's dive deeper into the various components and technologies involved in our solution:

#### MariaDB Replication

To ensure reliable synchronization, we utilize the built-in replication feature of MariaDB. We configure the San Francisco database server (DBServerSF) as the master database and the European database server (DBServerEU) as the slave replica. This allows us to automatically replicate changes made to the master to the slave in near-real-time.

#### Checkpoint CloudGuard Sync

To synchronize databases across geographical locations, we leverage the powerful capabilities of **Checkpoint CloudGuard Sync**. This cloud-based service provides secure and efficient data replication, ensuring that updates made on one database are seamlessly propagated to the other. CloudGuard Sync employs advanced algorithms to minimize data transfer and optimize performance, further enhancing the synchronization process.

#### Automation and Monitoring

To eliminate manual intervention and ensure continuous synchronization, we employ robust automation techniques. A dedicated server running in our San Francisco office monitors the master database for any write operations. Upon receiving a write query, the monitoring server triggers the synchronization process, ensuring that changes are promptly propagated to the slave database in Europe.

### Implementation Steps

Implementing our solution involves a series of steps:

1. Set up MariaDB replication between DBServerSF (master) and DBServerEU (slave).
2. Sign up for Checkpoint CloudGuard Sync and configure your database servers accordingly.
3. Deploy an automation server in your primary location (e.g., San Francisco) to monitor write queries and trigger sync requests.
4. Configure firewall rules and VPN connections to ensure secure communication between servers and the CloudGuard Sync service.

## Results and Benefits

By implementing our overengineered solution, we have achieved significant improvements in database synchronization for business continuity at ShitOps. Some of the notable benefits include:

1. **Real-Time Data Replication**: With the power of MariaDB replication and CloudGuard Sync, we achieve near-real-time synchronization between our geographically distributed databases.
2. **Automated Failover**: In the event of a disaster or server outage, our system automatically fails over to the replica database without any manual intervention.
3. **Optimized Performance**: The advanced algorithms used by CloudGuard Sync minimize data transfer and optimize performance, ensuring efficient synchronization with minimal latency.
4. **Data Security**: Our solution includes robust security measures, such as encrypted communication channels and firewall rules, to protect sensitive data during synchronization.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored our innovative solution for synchronizing mission-critical databases across geographical locations. By combining MariaDB replication with Checkpoint CloudGuard Sync and intelligent automation techniques, we have created an overengineered yet effective solution for seamless data synchronization. Despite the complexity and potential downsides of our implementation, we are confident in its ability to support ShitOps' business continuity plan and ensure uninterrupted operations.
