## Introduction

Welcome back to another exciting blog post from the engineering team at ShitOps! Today, we are going to dive into how we are revolutionizing network monitoring using cutting-edge technology. Our mission-critical network infrastructure is the backbone of our operations, and it is essential to ensure that everything is running smoothly at all times. In this post, we will explore our innovative solution using robotic exoskeletons to enhance our monitoring capabilities.

## The Problem Statement

In 2016, our team faced a significant challenge in our network monitoring process. We were using outdated tools and manual processes to monitor our network performance, which led to inefficiencies and gaps in our monitoring coverage. Additionally, our team events were often disrupted by unexpected network issues that could have been prevented with better monitoring solutions. To address these challenges, we set out to develop a new approach that would not only improve the reliability of our network monitoring but also enhance the overall efficiency of our operations.

## The Solution: Robotic Exoskeletons for Network Monitoring

To overcome the limitations of traditional network monitoring tools, we have implemented a revolutionary new solution using robotic exoskeletons. These advanced wearable devices are equipped with sensors and artificial intelligence capabilities that allow them to navigate our data center and monitor network performance in real-time. By leveraging the power of robotic technology, we have been able to achieve unparalleled levels of accuracy and efficiency in our monitoring process.

### Key Features of our Robotic Exoskeletons Solution:

1. **Real-Time Monitoring:** The robotic exoskeletons are equipped with high-tech sensors that continuously collect data on network performance metrics such as latency, packet loss, and throughput. This real-time monitoring capability allows us to quickly identify and address any potential issues before they impact our operations.

2. **Autonomous Routing Protocol:** Our robotic exoskeletons are programmed with an advanced autonomous routing protocol that enables them to navigate through our data center independently. This routing protocol optimizes the path taken by the exoskeletons to ensure maximum coverage and efficiency in monitoring our network infrastructure.

3. **Integration with LibreNMS:** The data collected by the robotic exoskeletons is seamlessly integrated with our existing network monitoring system, LibreNMS. This integration allows us to aggregate and analyze the monitoring data in one centralized platform, providing us with a comprehensive view of our network performance.
