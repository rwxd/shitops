## Introduction

Office door knocking is a common practice that has been around for decades. It is a quick and effective way to get someone's attention without disturbing other people in the room. However, it can also be a source of inconvenience and distraction, especially in open plan offices. The sound of knocking can be disruptive, and people may have to stop what they are doing to answer the door. Additionally, some people may not feel comfortable with unexpected visitors, which can lead to unnecessary stress and anxiety. In this blog post, we will present a technical solution to this problem that will make office door knocking a thing of the past.

## The Problem

The problem with office door knocking is that it is a human-to-human interaction that can be difficult to automate or optimize. It requires people to physically move from one place to another, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Additionally, it can be difficult to gauge the urgency or importance of a knock, which can lead to unnecessary interruptions. Finally, some people may not feel comfortable with unexpected visitors, which can lead to unnecessary stress and anxiety.

## The Solution

The solution to the inconvenience of office door knocking is a sound recognition system that can detect and interpret specific sounds. The system will be installed in every office and will be able to recognize the sound of a knock. Once the sound is detected, the system will communicate with the occupant of the room through a visual interface, such as a smartwatch or a computer screen. The interface will display a message that informs the occupant of the knock and allows them to choose whether or not to respond.

The system will work as follows:

1. A person will knock on the door of a closed office.
2. The sound of the knock will be detected by the sound recognition system.
3. The system will notify the occupant of the room through a visual interface.
4. The occupant will be given the option to respond to the knock or ignore it.
5. If the occupant responds, the door will unlock automatically, and the visitor will be allowed to enter the room.

## Technical Implementation

The technical implementation of the sound recognition system will be based on machine learning algorithms that are trained to recognize the sound of a knock. The system will be equipped with microphones that are strategically placed throughout the office to ensure that the sound is captured accurately. The captured audio will be processed by a neural network that will determine whether or not the sound is a knock. Once a knock is detected, the system will communicate with the occupant of the room through a visual interface.

The visual interface will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use. It will consist of a simple message that provides the occupant with the necessary information to make a decision. The message will be displayed on a smartwatch or computer screen, depending on the preference of the user. The occupant will be able to respond to the message by pressing a button or swiping the screen.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the inconvenience of office door knocking can be eliminated with a sound recognition system that is based on machine learning algorithms. The system will be able to detect and interpret the sound of a knock, and communicate with the occupant of the room through a visual interface. This will make office door knocking a thing of the past, and improve the overall efficiency and productivity of the workplace.
