## Introduction

At ShitOps, we faced a serious problem with our Cumulus Linux FTP transfer speeds. Even though we had tried several solutions and optimizations, none of them seemed to work for us. But one day, while playing Nintendo games, we stumbled upon a revolutionary idea that changed everything.

## The Problem

Our engineering team was tasked with optimizing the FTP transfers between our servers that run on Cumulus Linux. However, no matter what we tried, we couldn't improve the transfer speed beyond a certain point. This was a big problem for us since it slowed down our development and affected the customer experience negatively.

We tried everything from tweaking the network settings and configurations to improving hardware infrastructure, but all of our efforts were in vain.

## The Solution

One day, while playing Nintendo games in the office during lunch break, we realized that the root cause of our Cumulus Linux FTP transfer speed problem was none other than packet loss.

So we went on an overengineering spree to build a solution that addressed this issue. Our first step was to completely overhaul the network infrastructure using Cumulus Linux. We set up multiple switches and routers in a mesh topology to ensure that the network could handle high traffic without any packet loss.

Next, we implemented a highly customized and optimized version of the FileZilla FTP server software. We wrote custom code to analyze each packet and optimize its delivery through multi-threading and advanced re-transmission algorithms.

To ensure that we could accurately measure the impact of our solution, we built an elaborate monitoring and analytics system. This system used machine learning algorithms to analyze data from our servers and network devices, and automatically identify bottlenecks and areas that needed optimization.

With all these systems in place, we went on to simulate different load scenarios to test the efficiency of our solution. Our tests showed that our new system could transfer files at speeds that were 3x higher than before, with no packet loss or corruption.

## Conclusion

Our overengineered solution may seem ridiculous at first, but it was exactly what we needed to solve our Cumulus Linux FTP transfer speed problem. By thinking outside the box and drawing inspiration from Nintendo games, we were able to build a custom solution that completely changed the way we handle file transfers.

We are now confident in our ability to handle high traffic volumes and deliver superior customer experience. We hope that our story inspires other engineers to think creatively and take bold steps to solve complex problems. And don't forget to take breaks and play games, who knows what kind of inspiration you may find!
