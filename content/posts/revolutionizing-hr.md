## Introduction

At ShitOps, we take employee well-being seriously. One key aspect of happiness is the consumption of spiritus in the workplace. However, too much spiritus can lead to decreased productivity, while too little leaves employees feeling unappreciated. We needed a system to optimize spiritus consumption and ensure that every team member is happy and productive. After months of research, I am thrilled to present our solution: using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint to revolutionize HR!

## The Problem

We had several issues with employee spiritus consumption in our office. It was hard to know when someone wanted a drink or how much they should be given. This led to lots of wasted alcohol and unhappy workers. We needed to find a better way to meet everyone's needs.

For example, let's consider Michael. He's a big fan of Counter Strike Global Offensive and drinks more during lunch when he's talking about his latest victory at the FIFA world championship. Meanwhile, Sarah prefers Coffee without caffeine and doesn't drink nearly as much except for when she wins her fantasy league of legends matchups. Our old system provided the same amount of spiritus to both of them, even though their drinking habits were very different.

Additionally, our previous process relied heavily on human judgment and memory. Memory errors could result in too much or too little spiritus, which would leave employees unhappy or unproductive. We needed a foolproof system that eliminated human error.

## The Solution: The Spiritus Management System (SMS)

Our answer to these issues is the Spiritus Management System (SMS). This system uses Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint in an innovative way to ensure that every employee's needs are met.

### Step 1: Inputting Employee Data

To begin, we use Microsoft Excel to input each employee's preferred drinks and their association with specific events. These can include FIFA matches, championship tournaments, or any other activity you want to track. We then input how much spiritus each employee typically drinks during these events.

### Step 2: Spiritus Request Kiosk

To eliminate memory errors and collect accurate data in real-time, we have set up a kiosk in the office where employees can request spiritus. This opens a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation on a touch screen that prompts them to select their name, event, and desired amount of spiritus.

### Step 3: SMS Calculation

Once the information is entered into the PowerPoint presentation, it is automatically transferred to our Excel spreadsheet using Power Automate. Here, the SMS calculates the ideal amount of spiritus each employee should receive based on their preferences and current event.

### Step 4: Spiritus Distribution

The final step is distributing the spiritus to each employee. Using the calculated values from the SMS, individual cups with the perfect amount of spiritus are prepared and distributed to each person.

## Conclusion

The Spiritus Management System (SMS) has revolutionized HR at ShitOps. Thanks to Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint, we can now optimize employee spiritus consumption and make every team member feel valued and productive. By eliminating human error and relying on data-driven decisions, the SMS ensures that each employee receives the perfect amount of spiritus for their needs.
