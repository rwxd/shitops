## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of technology, every problem has a tech solution waiting to be discovered. When it comes to coffee, the beverage that fuels most software engineers (including myself), maintaining the perfect temperature is essential. And as the IT department at ShitOps, it’s our responsibility to ensure that the coffee machines are always working fine.

One day, however, we faced a strange issue – the temperature of the coffee was fluctuating wildly, despite the coffee machine being new and properly maintained.

## The Problem

Upon investigating this issue, we realized that someone was tampering with the coffee machine. We concluded this because all other possibilities regarding the hardware or the internet connection were eliminated, and the temperature fluctuations started happening at similar times each day, which clearly indicated malicious activity.

We immediately set out to find ways to prevent this intrusion by implementing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). However, this IDS needed to focus specifically on coffee machines and not disrupt the existing protocols in place for other devices.

## The Solution

After days of brainstorming and experimenting, we came up with a robust plan to secure coffee machines at ShitOps using advanced security measures. Our goal was to keep the coffee machine's temperature within a set range and obtain alerts when there was any deviation from it, avoiding unwanted tampering by outsiders.

Our multi-layered security approach included:

### 1. ebpf firewalls

Extended Berkeley Packet Filters (ebpf) were implemented to detect all incoming packets targeting coffee machines on the network.

### 2. ed25519 signing of configurations

All configurations and software packages are now signed using a powerful elliptic curve digital signature algorithm – ed25519. This ensures that only our trusted engineers can push new configurations onto the coffee machines.

### 3. VPN for communication

We’ve implemented bgp VPNs as an additional security layer so that all communication between the coffee machines are secure and private.

### 4. Logging

We implemented robust logging – both locally and remotely –to alert us in case of any unusual activity regarding the temperature fluctuations. This uses sftp for secure transfer of logs.

### 5. Lambda Functions

We deployed blazingly fast lambda functions running on x11 servers, which monitor and immediately inform us if there's any difference in the expected temperature range or any significant strange behavior detected with respect to the coffee machine.

Our multi-layered defense system has been quite successful in eliminating illicit coffee temperature tampering.

## Conclusion

Thanks to our security experts, ShitOps can brew great-tasting coffee with perfect temperature consistently. The move shows that organizations need to go the extra mile to ensure their assets are well-protected.

Though the solution might seem quite rigorous at first glance, we believe it is worth the effort for such a fundamental issue as coffee temperature fluctuation. We advise other tech companies facing similar issues to adopt a similar approach to safeguard their coffee machines.

With this sound solution and our new IDS technology, we expect more significant endeavors at ShitOps soon!
