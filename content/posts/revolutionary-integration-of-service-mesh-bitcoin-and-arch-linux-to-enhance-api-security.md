## Introduction

At ShitOps, we take security extremely seriously. As an engineering team, we are always thinking about new innovative solutions to stay ahead of potential threats. Recently, we noticed some vulnerabilities in our APIs, which led us to explore new ways of enhancing their security. In this blog post, I will introduce a revolutionary integration of service mesh, bitcoin, and Arch Linux to secure our APIs.

## The Challenge

APIs serve as the backbone of connected systems used by our customers, partners, and developers. They are often exposed to different types of attacks, such as DDoS, injection, phishing, and unauthorized access. Some of these attacks can be prevented by following security best practices, such as using HTTPS, OAuth, JWT, and rate limiting. However, some attacks require more sophisticated solutions that involve machine learning, behavioral analysis, and data mining.

One of the challenges we faced was how to prevent malicious traffic from reaching our APIs before it causes any harm. We wanted a solution that would allow us to block bad actors at the network level, regardless of their IPs or user agents. We also wanted to be able to enforce strict policies on the traffic that is allowed to reach our APIs, based on context, identity, and intent.

## The Solution

After months of research and development, we came up with a groundbreaking solution that integrates three cutting-edge technologies: service mesh, bitcoin, and Arch Linux. This solution leverages the power of distributed consensus, cryptography, and microservices to provide a high level of security, scalability, and resiliency.

### Service Mesh

Service mesh is a modern approach to networking that emphasizes the separation of concerns between application logic and network infrastructure. It involves using sidecar proxies to handle all the communication between the microservices that make up an application. Service mesh provides several benefits, including traffic management, load balancing, service discovery, encryption, and observability.

At ShitOps, we use Istio as our service mesh implementation. Istio provides us with a rich set of features, including mTLS, Envoy proxy, Mixer policy engine, and Prometheus metrics. However, we wanted to extend Istio's capabilities to address our API security needs.

### Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions and create new coins. Bitcoin is based on a distributed ledger called the blockchain, which records all transactional data in a tamper-proof and auditable manner. Bitcoin is powered by a network of nodes that validate and propagate transactions, ensuring their integrity and consistency.

At ShitOps, we saw an opportunity to leverage the security and decentralization properties of bitcoin to enhance our API security. We created a custom plugin for Istio that allows us to receive payments in bitcoin from external clients who want to access our APIs.

The plugin works as follows:

1. A client sends a request to access our API.
2. The request is intercepted by the Envoy proxy running on the sidecar.
3. The Envoy proxy checks whether the request contains a valid bitcoin payment.
4. If the payment is found to be valid, the request is forwarded to the API backend. Otherwise, the request is rejected.

To ensure that the payment is valid, we require the client to include a bitcoin transaction ID in the request headers. The transaction must be confirmed on the bitcoin network within a certain time frame, otherwise, the request will be rejected.

We also use bitcoin as a means of incentivizing good behavior from our clients. We offer discounts on API access fees to clients who pay in bitcoin and follow our security policies.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and customization. Arch Linux provides a rolling release model, which means that updates are released as soon as they are available, allowing users to always stay up-to-date with the latest software.

At ShitOps, we chose Arch Linux as our operating system of choice for our API servers. We configured our servers to run all the necessary microservices in containers using Docker. We also installed various security tools and utilities, such as iptables, fail2ban, and AppArmor.

To enhance our API security, we created a custom script that runs on top of Arch Linux, called ArchSec. ArchSec is designed to monitor and analyze network traffic at the kernel level, using eBPF filters. ArchSec works by intercepting all incoming and outgoing packets before they reach the application layer. It then applies a set of rules that we defined based on our security policies. If a packet violates any of the rules, it is dropped, and an alert is triggered.

The following diagram illustrates the flow of traffic in our new API security solution:

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we presented a revolutionary integration of service mesh, bitcoin, and Arch Linux to enhance our API security. Our solution leverages the power of distributed consensus, cryptography, and microservices to provide a high level of security, scalability, and resiliency. While our solution may seem overengineered and complex to some, we are confident that it provides the best possible protection for our APIs.
