## Introduction

In today's fast-paced and globally connected world, distributed teams have become the norm for tech companies. However, communicating effectively across different time zones and locations can be a real challenge. At ShitOps, we believe that effective communication is the key to successful teamwork and project delivery. That's why we set out to find an innovative solution to enhance communication in distributed teams using advanced haptic technology. In this blog post, we will explore the problem of communication in distributed teams and present our overengineered solution using cutting-edge haptic technology.

## The Problem

As a tech company with offices and team members spread across the globe, ShitOps faces numerous challenges when it comes to communication. Despite having various messaging, video conferencing, and project management tools at our disposal, we often encounter issues such as miscommunication, delays in response times, and lack of collaboration. This not only hampers productivity but also affects team morale and reduces the overall efficiency of our projects. We needed a solution that could bridge the gap caused by time zones and physical distances and create a more immersive and engaging communication experience for our distributed teams.

## Introducing Threema-Tactile™: Next-Level Communication Platform

To address the communication challenges faced by our distributed teams, we have developed Threema-Tactile™, a groundbreaking communication platform that utilizes haptic technology to provide a seamless and immersive communication experience. By combining the power of haptics and digital communication, Threema-Tactile™ allows team members to feel each other's presence, emotions, and messages in real-time.

### System Architecture

The architecture of Threema-Tactile™ is built on a robust and scalable infrastructure using AWS (Amazon Web Services) for maximum reliability and availability. The key components of the system include:

1. **Threema-Tactile™ Mobile App**: This app acts as the primary interface for users to send and receive haptic messages. It leverages the power of Haptic Feedback API on modern smartphones to deliver rich and immersive haptic experiences.

2. **Threema-Tactile™ Server**: This server component handles the transmission and synchronization of haptic messages between distributed team members. It runs on a fleet of EC2 instances in AWS and utilizes QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol for ultra-fast and secure communication.

3. **Threema-Tactile™ Gateway**: The gateway serves as the bridge between the Threema-Tactile™ Server and external messaging platforms like email, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. It converts standard text-based messages into haptic format and ensures seamless integration with existing communication channels.

## How Threema-Tactile™ Works

Threema-Tactile™ revolutionizes communication in distributed teams by enabling team members to send and receive haptic messages that mimic physical touch and gestures. Let's take a closer look at the key features of Threema-Tactile™ and how they enhance communication:

### 1. Haptic Emojis

Emojis have become an integral part of modern digital communication, allowing users to express emotions visually. With Threema-Tactile™, we take emojis to the next level by adding haptic feedback. Each haptic emoji is carefully crafted to simulate tactile sensations associated with various emotions. For example, sending a thumbs-up haptic emoji will transmit a gentle vibration accompanied by a positive feedback sound, replicating the sensation of encouragement and agreement.

### 2. Haptic Text Messaging

Threema-Tactile™ introduces a new way of messaging called "Haptic Text Messaging." Instead of relying solely on text-based messages, users can now communicate by sending haptic patterns and vibrations. For instance, sending a series of short taps could indicate urgency or importance, while a longer continuous vibration could convey excitement or anticipation.

### 3. Virtual High-Fives

High-fives are a common gesture used to celebrate accomplishments and show support. In a distributed team environment, physical high-fives are impossible, but with Threema-Tactile™, virtual high-fives become a reality. By synchronizing haptic vibrations between team members, Threema-Tactile™ allows users to feel the impact of a high-five in real-time, creating a sense of camaraderie and celebration even across continents.

### 4. Haptic Presence

Threema-Tactile™ goes beyond traditional "online/offline" status indicators by introducing the concept of "haptic presence." When a team member is actively working on a project or task, their haptic avatar becomes more prominent, indicating their availability for collaboration. Team members can sense the level of engagement and focus of their colleagues through haptic vibrations, fostering a more intuitive understanding of each other's availability and workload.

## Conclusion

At ShitOps, we believe that effective communication is the lifeline of distributed teams. With Threema-Tactile™, we have pushed the boundaries of communication technology by combining the power of haptics and digital messaging. By introducing haptic feedback, we aim to create a more immersive and engaging communication experience for distributed teams, bridging the gap caused by physical distances and time zones. While our solution may seem complex and overengineered to some, we are excited about the possibilities it offers in terms of enhancing collaboration, improving team morale, and ultimately delivering better results. Join us on this journey as we revolutionize communication in distributed teams with the power of haptic technology!
