Today, I am thrilled to share with you a revolutionary solution that will completely transform the way finance operates in 2022 and beyond. We will be diving deep into the world of hyperautomation, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as VMware NSX-T, Rust, rsync, and more to create a seamless and efficient financial ecosystem. So buckle up and get ready for an exhilarating journey through the realms of overengineering!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revolutionizing Speech-to-Text with DockerHub and Rust</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-speech-to-text-with-dockerhub-and-rust/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 18:07:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-speech-to-text-with-dockerhub-and-rust/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At ShitOps, we faced a major challenge when it came to speech-to-text transcription for our television projects. Our team was using outdated technology, and the quality of transcriptions just wasn&amp;rsquo;t always meeting our standards. So, we put on our thinking caps and went looking for an innovative solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After trying out a variety of options, including off-the-shelf software and third-party tools, we finally produced a new proprietary solution. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, our revamped system is optimized to provide top-tier speech-to-text transcription at a level that simply isn&amp;rsquo;t achievable with other technology.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
