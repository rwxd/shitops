&lt;p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the ShitOps engineering blog! Today, we are going to delve into the world of infrastructure monitoring and explore how we can revolutionize it using cutting-edge technologies such as Icinga2 and Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Imagine a scenario where the team is in the midst of a crucial Dark matter exploration project, and suddenly, the entire infrastructure goes down due to a network outage. Chaos ensues as the team scrambles to identify the root cause of the issue. In the midst of this chaos, critical alerts are missed, and valuable time is wasted in bringing the infrastructure back up. This is a nightmare scenario for any tech company, including ShitOps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving Business Continuity with Kubernetes and AI-driven Event-driven Programming</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/improving-business-continuity-with-kubernetes-and-ai-driven-event-driven-programming/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 00:09:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/improving-business-continuity-with-kubernetes-and-ai-driven-event-driven-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p>Listen to the interview with our engineer: &lt;figure class="audio">
