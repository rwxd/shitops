&lt;p>Greetings, fellow engineers! Today, I want to present an innovative solution that we have implemented at ShitOps to revolutionize the way we control temperature in our fridges. We all know how important it is, especially when dealing with sensitive products like vaccines. So, let&amp;rsquo;s dive right into it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our offices are located in Berlin, where temperatures can be quite inconsistent throughout the year. In winter, it can get really cold, and in summer, it can be scorching hot. In addition, our previous fridge models were not very efficient when it came to regulating temperature, which created a lot of waste and unnecessary expenses. Some of our more advanced software systems even began overheating due to the poor quality of the fridges.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
