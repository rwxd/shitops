As a leading tech company, we have various applications that run on top of our databases. Our main database system is running on Postgresql, which had become the primary cause of performance issues.
We were facing major issues related to query speed and storage space. Our database was becoming inefficient day by day due to excessive write operations from Hamburg office.</description></item><item><title>Revolutionize Your Grafana Dashboard with AI-Machine Learning-Powered Predictive Analytics</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionize-your-grafana-dashboard-with-ai-machine-learning-powered-predictive-analytics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 19:16:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionize-your-grafana-dashboard-with-ai-machine-learning-powered-predictive-analytics/</guid><description>Introduction At ShitOps, we take our monitoring and observability seriously, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we use the best-in-class tools to make sure our applications keep running smoothly.
