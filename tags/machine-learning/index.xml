While this policy has allowed for greater flexibility and productivity amongst employees, it has resulted in an overwhelming amount of mobile devices being connected to the wireless network. We saw an increase in network congestion, resource consumption, and security risks. After several brainstorming sessions, we arrived at a solution that involved using neural networks, IMAP, and Juniper switches.</description></item><item><title>Solving Performance Issues in Postgresql with Distributed Machine Learning</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/solving-performance-issues-in-postgresql-with-distributed-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 19:34:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/solving-performance-issues-in-postgresql-with-distributed-machine-learning/</guid><description>Introduction At ShitOps, we faced a serious problem with our database system. As a leading tech company, we have various applications that run on top of our databases. Our main database system is running on Postgresql, which had become the primary cause of performance issues.
We were facing major issues related to query speed and storage space. Our database was becoming inefficient day by day due to excessive write operations from Hamburg office.</description></item><item><title>Revolutionize Your Grafana Dashboard with AI-Machine Learning-Powered Predictive Analytics</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionize-your-grafana-dashboard-with-ai-machine-learning-powered-predictive-analytics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 19:16:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionize-your-grafana-dashboard-with-ai-machine-learning-powered-predictive-analytics/</guid><description>Introduction At ShitOps, we take our monitoring and observability seriously, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we use the best-in-class tools to make sure our applications keep running smoothly. One such tool we heavily rely on is Grafanaâ€”a popular open-source platform for creating dashboards and visualizing time-series data. However, we noticed a recurring problem in our Grafana setup that was causing us headaches.
The Problem Our monitoring stack generated tons of metrics every minute, which made it difficult to keep track of all the trends and patterns.</description></item></channel></rss>
