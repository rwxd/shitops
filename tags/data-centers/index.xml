Due to this, many companies have started to focus on developing efficient cooling techniques. At ShitOps, we also encountered a similar problem. Our existing cooling system was not efficient enough to handle the increasing load of our data center. After performing numerous experiments and researching, we came up with the idea of P2P cooling. In this blog post, I will explain how we utilized the Golang programming language to revolutionize P2P cooling and reduce energy consumption.</description></item></channel></rss>
