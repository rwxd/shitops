&lt;p>At ShitOps, we recently faced a problem with our mobile email chat platform. Our customers were not happy with the UI and lack of customization options. We noticed that many customers were shifting to other platforms due to these complaints. As engineers, we knew we needed to come up with an advanced solution to solve this issue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our mobile email chat app lacked a personal touch. The users wanted more control of the app&amp;rsquo;s settings and customization. They found it challenging to focus on important emails and frequently missed them, causing delays in business communications. We also had complaints about the absence of intelligent message categorization and prioritization tools. Users felt that too much irrelevant content was pushed to them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
