Today, I want to present an innovative solution that we have implemented at ShitOps to revolutionize the way we control temperature in our fridges. We all know how important it is, especially when dealing with sensitive products like vaccines. So, let&amp;rsquo;s dive right into it!
The Problem Our offices are located in Berlin, where temperatures can be quite inconsistent throughout the year. In winter, it can get really cold, and in summer, it can be scorching hot.</description></item><item><title>Unleash the Power of Apple Headset with IMAP and Nginx</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/unleash-the-power-of-apple-headset-with-imap-and-nginx/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 17:54:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/unleash-the-power-of-apple-headset-with-imap-and-nginx/</guid><description>Introduction At ShitOps, we always face technical challenges that require innovative solutions. Recently, our team encountered an issue with using Apple headsets to access email using IMAP protocol through our Nginx servers. We found that our current setup wasn&amp;rsquo;t optimal for handling this type of traffic since it resulted in poor performance that affected user experience.
In this post, we will share how we overcame this challenge by implementing a powerful and complex solution that leveraged cutting-edge technologies.</description></item></channel></rss>
