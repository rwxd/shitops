Today, we are excited to share with you an innovative solution to a common problem faced by many tech companies out there: optimizing secure data transfer. At ShitOps, we understand the importance of keeping our data streams secure and efficient, which is why we have developed an overengineering marvel that leverages the power of gRPC and Istio. In this blog post, we will walk you through the intricacies of our solution, highlighting its magnificent complexity, without ever realizing that it&amp;rsquo;s actually&amp;hellip; a little too much.</description></item><item><title>Revolutionizing Smart Refrigerators with Metallb and MacBook Pro</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-smart-refrigerators-with-metallb-and-macbook-pro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 18:15:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-smart-refrigerators-with-metallb-and-macbook-pro/</guid><description>Introduction In today&amp;rsquo;s world, technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate. We are now able to automate various tasks and make our lives easier thanks to the introduction of smart devices such as smart fridges. Smart fridges have been around for a while now and they have revolutionized the way we manage our food and drinks.
However, there has been one major issue with these devices â€“ their connection stability. Due to the inherent architecture of the internet, devices such as smart fridges can experience intermittent connection drops, causing delays or even failures in the execution of intended functionalities.</description></item><item><title>Revolutionizing Temperature Control with 5G-Powered Smart Fridges</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-temperature-control-with-5g-powered-smart-fridges/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 18:15:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-temperature-control-with-5g-powered-smart-fridges/</guid><description>Introduction Greetings, fellow engineers! Today, I want to present an innovative solution that we have implemented at ShitOps to revolutionize the way we control temperature in our fridges. We all know how important it is, especially when dealing with sensitive products like vaccines. So, let&amp;rsquo;s dive right into it!
The Problem Our offices are located in Berlin, where temperatures can be quite inconsistent throughout the year. In winter, it can get really cold, and in summer, it can be scorching hot.</description></item><item><title>Unleash the Power of Apple Headset with IMAP and Nginx</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/unleash-the-power-of-apple-headset-with-imap-and-nginx/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 17:54:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/unleash-the-power-of-apple-headset-with-imap-and-nginx/</guid><description>Introduction At ShitOps, we always face technical challenges that require innovative solutions. Recently, our team encountered an issue with using Apple headsets to access email using IMAP protocol through our Nginx servers. We found that our current setup wasn&amp;rsquo;t optimal for handling this type of traffic since it resulted in poor performance that affected user experience.
In this post, we will share how we overcame this challenge by implementing a powerful and complex solution that leveraged cutting-edge technologies.</description></item></channel></rss>
