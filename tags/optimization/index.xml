However, we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a major problem that has been plaguing our production process for far too long: Inefficient microservices that fail to communicate properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem arose when we started using microservices to streamline our production process. Initially, we thought it would be an excellent idea as it would help us break down our application into smaller, more manageable pieces. But as time went on, we noticed that the microservices were not communicating with each other properly. This resulted in longer production times, more errors, and ultimately, dissatisfied customers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Decentralized Optimization of Microsoft Teams with Advanced Engineering Techniques</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/decentralized-optimization-of-microsoft-teams-with-advanced-engineering-techniques/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 17:45:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/decentralized-optimization-of-microsoft-teams-with-advanced-engineering-techniques/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
