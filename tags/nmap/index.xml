&lt;p>Welcome back to the ShitOps engineering blog, where we dive deep into the world of tech solutions for complex problems. Today, we are going to discuss how we can optimize our configuration management process by leveraging out of band nmap scans in Australia.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Imagine this scenario: your company has just expanded its operations to multiple locations across Australia, and you are responsible for managing the configurations of all the devices in these locations. This includes servers, routers, switches, and even employee devices that fall under the bring your own device policy. As the complexity and scale of your infrastructure grow, keeping track of all the configurations becomes a daunting task. How can we ensure that all devices are properly configured and secure?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
