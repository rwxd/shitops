Our VMware Tanzu Kubernetes cluster was at significant risk due to the complexity of its configuration using BGP for networking and Kafka for message queuing.
We needed a robust solution to ensure that our Kubernetes resources, such as services, endpoints, and pods, were protected from unauthorized traffic. We also wanted to maintain visibility and control over all inbound and outbound network traffic flowing between the microservices in the service mesh.</description></item></channel></rss>
