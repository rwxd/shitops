&lt;p>As our company continues to grow, the volume of DNS records that we manage has also increased significantly. Manually updating and configuring these records has become a time-consuming and error-prone task for our team. Additionally, ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices has become a challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solving DNS Resolution Issues at Scale with Microsoft, GNMI, Juniper, Mainframe, Mesh, Self Hosting, Lambda Functions and Open Source</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/solving-dns-resolution-issues-at-scale-with-microsoft-gnmi-juniper-mainframe-mesh-self-hosting-lambda-functions-and-open-source/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 11:35:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/solving-dns-resolution-issues-at-scale-with-microsoft-gnmi-juniper-mainframe-mesh-self-hosting-lambda-functions-and-open-source/</guid><description>&lt;p>Listen to the interview with our engineer: &lt;figure class="audio">

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>DNS resolution is a critical part of the network infrastructure for any tech company. It helps in resolving human-readable domain names into IP addresses and vice versa, but at the cost of adding latency to network requests, which can further impact the performance of applications that depend on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, our tech company ShitOps faced a DNS resolution issue at scale, due to the increasing number of services added on the network infrastructure. We realized that the traditional approach of using a central DNS server was no longer sufficient to handle this scale.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
