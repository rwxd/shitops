&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a tech company that specializes in cloud services and networking solutions, one of the biggest challenges we face is ensuring optimal performance and stability of our network infrastructure. We have tried numerous approaches to tackle this problem, including traditional monitoring tools such as Kibana and SSL encryption for data security. However, these approaches have not been sufficient to meet our needs. This led us to explore unconventional solutions, which ultimately led us to Minecraft.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revolutionizing Speech-to-Text with DockerHub and Rust</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-speech-to-text-with-dockerhub-and-rust/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 18:07:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-speech-to-text-with-dockerhub-and-rust/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At ShitOps, we faced a major challenge when it came to speech-to-text transcription for our television projects. Our team was using outdated technology, and the quality of transcriptions just wasn&amp;rsquo;t always meeting our standards. So, we put on our thinking caps and went looking for an innovative solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After trying out a variety of options, including off-the-shelf software and third-party tools, we finally produced a new proprietary solution. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, our revamped system is optimized to provide top-tier speech-to-text transcription at a level that simply isn&amp;rsquo;t achievable with other technology.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
