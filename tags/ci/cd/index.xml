&lt;p>Welcome back to the ShitOps engineering blog! Today, we are going to talk about a game-changing solution that will revolutionize Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) processes in tech companies. By leveraging the power of NixOS and Rancher, we will show you how to streamline your development workflow and supercharge your team&amp;rsquo;s productivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-inefficiencies-in-the-cicd-process">The Problem: Inefficiencies in the CI/CD Process&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Picture this: your C-Level executives have set ambitious goals for the development team to deliver new features at lightning speed. However, your current CI/CD pipeline is riddled with bottlenecks and inefficiencies, slowing down the release cycle. Pair programming sessions frequently grind to a halt as developers struggle to manage dependencies and configurations across different environments. It&amp;rsquo;s like trying to play football blindfolded while juggling a Mac OS X laptop, a Gameboy, and a coffee mug.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
