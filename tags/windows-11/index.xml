&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s rapidly evolving technological landscape, network security is more crucial than ever. With the rise of sophisticated cyber threats and the increasing complexity of network architectures, traditional security measures are struggling to keep up. That&amp;rsquo;s where Software-defined Networking (SDN) comes in. By separating the control plane from the data plane, SDN allows for more flexible and dynamic network management, making it an ideal solution for modern security challenges. In this blog post, we will explore how we can revolutionize network security using SDN with the latest technologies such as Windows 11 and Azure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revolutionizing Green Telemetry Solutions with Extreme Programming in Windows 11 for 2021</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-green-telemetry-solutions-with-extreme-programming-in-windows-11-for-2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:10:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-green-telemetry-solutions-with-extreme-programming-in-windows-11-for-2021/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Welcome back to the ShitOps engineering blog, where we constantly strive to push the boundaries of technology and innovation. In this post, we will be diving into our latest project that aims to revolutionize Green Telemetry solutions using Extreme Programming principles on the newly released Windows 11 platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-statement">The Problem Statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, it has become increasingly crucial for companies to monitor their systems&amp;rsquo; environmental impact. As a leading tech company, ShitOps is committed to reducing our carbon footprint and implementing sustainable practices across all our operations. However, we are facing a major challenge in accurately capturing and analyzing real-time telemetry data from our various servers running on CentOS.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
