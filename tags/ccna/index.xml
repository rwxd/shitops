&lt;p>Welcome back to the ShitOps engineering blog, where we explore cutting-edge solutions for complex technical challenges. In this post, we will delve into the optimization of multi-tenant smart grids using a Dockerized approach with Site-2-Site CCNA connectivity. By leveraging the power of VMware NSX-T, Icinga2 monitoring, and Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt for secure certificate management, we can revolutionize the way smart grids are managed in a multi-tenant environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-statement">The Problem Statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In traditional smart grid deployments, managing multiple tenants within a single infrastructure poses significant challenges. Each tenant requires dedicated resources, isolated networks, and secure connectivity, leading to operational complexity and increased maintenance overhead. Additionally, ensuring real-time monitoring and secure communication between different components of the smart grid is crucial for efficient operations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revolutionizing Observability with Apache CCNA Integration</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-observability-with-apache-ccna-integration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 00:09:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-observability-with-apache-ccna-integration/</guid><description>&lt;p>Listen to the interview with our engineer: &lt;figure class="audio">
