&lt;p>Welcome back to the ShitOps engineering blog, where we dive deep into the world of tech solutions for complex problems. Today, we are going to discuss how we can optimize our configuration management process by leveraging out of band nmap scans in Australia.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Imagine this scenario: your company has just expanded its operations to multiple locations across Australia, and you are responsible for managing the configurations of all the devices in these locations. This includes servers, routers, switches, and even employee devices that fall under the bring your own device policy. As the complexity and scale of your infrastructure grow, keeping track of all the configurations becomes a daunting task. How can we ensure that all devices are properly configured and secure?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revolutionizing Configuration Management with Quantum Supremacy</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-configuration-management-with-quantum-supremacy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 00:09:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionizing-configuration-management-with-quantum-supremacy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Listen to the interview with our engineer: &lt;figure class="audio">

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Welcome back to the ShitOps engineering blog, where we constantly push the boundaries of technology to solve the most complex problems in the industry. In this post, we will discuss how we are revolutionizing configuration management using the power of Quantum Supremacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At ShitOps, we have been facing a significant challenge with our current configuration management system. Our legacy system, built on Windows XP and PostgreSQL, has become increasingly unreliable and difficult to maintain. As our company continues to grow and scale, it is crucial for us to have a robust and efficient solution in place to manage configurations across all our servers and services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Blockchain-powered, AI-driven Cybersecurity Can Revolutionize DNS Resolver Performance</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/how-blockchain-powered-ai-driven-cybersecurity-can-revolutionize-dns-resolver-performance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:09:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/how-blockchain-powered-ai-driven-cybersecurity-can-revolutionize-dns-resolver-performance/</guid><description>&lt;p>Listen to the interview with our engineer: &lt;figure class="audio">
