Today, we are going to dive deep into the world of smart grids and explore how we can optimize the telemetry data processing using the power of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). But first, let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to understand the problem we are trying to solve.
The Problem As the demand for renewable energy increases, more and more smart grids are being deployed to efficiently manage and distribute power.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Swarm Robotics with Telemetry and Version Control for Disaster Recovery</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/optimizing-swarm-robotics-with-telemetry-and-version-control-for-disaster-recovery/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 00:09:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/optimizing-swarm-robotics-with-telemetry-and-version-control-for-disaster-recovery/</guid><description>Introduction Welcome back tech enthusiasts!
