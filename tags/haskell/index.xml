&lt;p>At ShitOps, we have always strived to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to technology and innovation. One area that has been a pain point for us is email management. With the sheer volume of emails flowing in and out of our servers every day, it has become increasingly challenging to efficiently manage and organize this critical communication channel. In this blog post, I will outline the revolutionary solution that our team of experts has developed using Haskell and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) to completely transform the way we handle emails at ShitOps.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
