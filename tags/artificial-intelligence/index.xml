&lt;p>Greetings engineers and tech enthusiasts! In this blog post, we are going to dive into the fascinating world of optimizing regression testing for Windows 10 using cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cyborg Assistants. As an experienced engineer, I am thrilled to unveil our revolutionary solution that will transform the way we perform regression testing at ShitOps. Strap on your seatbelts because we are in for a wild ride!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Revolutionize Your Grafana Dashboard with AI-Machine Learning-Powered Predictive Analytics</title><link>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionize-your-grafana-dashboard-with-ai-machine-learning-powered-predictive-analytics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 19:16:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shitops.de/posts/revolutionize-your-grafana-dashboard-with-ai-machine-learning-powered-predictive-analytics/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At ShitOps, we take our monitoring and observability seriously, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we use the best-in-class tools to make sure our applications keep running smoothly. One such tool we heavily rely on is Grafanaâ€”a popular open-source platform for creating dashboards and visualizing time-series data. However, we noticed a recurring problem in our Grafana setup that was causing us headaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our monitoring stack generated tons of metrics every minute, which made it difficult to keep track of all the trends and patterns. We tried setting alerts based on static threshold values, but they failed to capture the complexity of our systems and environment.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
