Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to unveil an extraordinary solution that will revolutionize the way we optimize CPU utilization in Agile development. Our aim is simple: to ensure that every single CPU cycle is put to its most efficient use. To achieve this ambitious goal, we will leverage cutting-edge technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) contact lenses and Neurofeedback. Brace yourselves for a mind-blowing journey!</description></item></channel></rss>
